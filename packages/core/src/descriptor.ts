  /**
   * This function takes any object, and returns `null` if the object
   * should not be treated as an array by the built-in validators, and
   * an iterable if the object should be treated as an array.
   *
   * If the underlying object is a simple array, it's fine to return it.
   *
   * You can also return an iterable, which will only be called if the
   * internals need to iterate over the values. This can save work if
   * the process of turning your value into an Array is expensive.
   *
   * For example, if you have an Immutable.js list that you want the
   * built-in validators to treat as a list, you could write:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const ENV = {
   *   asList(object) {
   *     if (List.isList(object) || Array.isArray(object)) {
   *       return object[Symbol.iterator]();
   *     } else {
   *       return null;
   *     }
   *   }
   * };
   * ```
   *
   * If you are working with a collection that doesn't already support
   * `Symbol.iterator`, you can easily adapt it. For example, say you're
   * working with an array-like structure that has a `toArray` method on
   * it.
   *
   * Cross Check might invoke asList multiple times, but will only invoke
   * the generator if it wants to validate the contents of the list.
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { isArray } from "@ember/array";
   *
   * const ENV = {
   *   asList(object) {
   *     // support built-in Arrays
   *     if (Array.isArray(object)) {
   *       return object;
   *     } else if (isArray(object)) {
   *       return iterable(object);
   *     } else {
   *       return null;
   *     }
   *   }
   * };
   *

   *   // This will only run if cross-check attempts to iterate,
   *   // so we don't need to worry about the cost of coercing into
   *   // an array.
   *   let array = object.toArray();
   *
