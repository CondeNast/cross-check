/**
 * Internals Vocabulary:
 *
 * Reference Type:
 *   Represents data that is not directly included in the parent object.
 *   Dereferencing a reference may be asynchronous.
 *
 * Inline Type:
 *   Represent data that is directly included in the parent object.
 *   They include scalars, lists and dictionaries.
 *
 * Value:
 *   A value of any type (reference or inline).
 *
 * Scalar (Inline):
 *   A single inline value.
 *
 * List (Inline):
 *   A list of inline values.
 *
 * Dictionary (Inline):
 *   A set of key-value pairs. A dictionary's values are inline value. A dictionary's keys are strings.
 *
 * Pointer (Reference):
 *   A reference to another value.
 *
 * Iterator (Reference):
 *   A reference to a sequence of values. Each iteration of an iterator may be asynchronous.
 *
 * Refined Type:
 *   A type that has a strict component and a draft component. Component must either both be inline
 *   or both be references. A type's draft component corresponds to distinctions in underlying
 *   storage and user interface elements, and is intended to make it possible to auto-save
 *   in-progress work in a user interface.

/**
 * The API for a Type in Crosscheck. It essentially provides the runtime code

 * - `serialize()`, which takes an already-validated value and serializes it
 *   into the wire format.
 * - `parse()`, which takes a valid serialized value and parses it into
 *   the JS representation.
